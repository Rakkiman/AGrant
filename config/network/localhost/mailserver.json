I don't know why they're hurrying this operation, but I think it has something to do with the Ridgeway murders in Jersey. Last meeting I had with the Enolsis guys, I overheard them talking about someone stealing some book or notes or something and then 'lighting up Jersey City'. They were furious. It was fucking scary, you know? Fucking zealots. But hey, they pay a lot, am I right?"

The killer is of unnatural origin, likely caused by experiments of late A. Hunt and the Heavens Society. Taskforce G has tracked them since Ridgeway murders and Groversville Flu. Need more intel on both, something is amiss. Your team consists of Goliath and Grace. Goliath: USAMRIID, knows hypergeometry, smart, efficient, in too deep soon. Grace: DEA, effective at disposal, egoistic, pedantic, at risk of exposure.   More information at GB, 34°43'28.5''N 113°48'00.8''W. From there, proceed to the scene with caution. Adam."
